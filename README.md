This workflow lets you add download links to JDownloader 2 using Alfred. 

To use it, just type the keyword followed by the link.
The first time this workflow is used, JDownloader will ask confirmation to allow Alfred to add the link; once given, JD won't ask confirmation again.

Alternatively, you can add links through Alfred's Clipboard Viewer.
